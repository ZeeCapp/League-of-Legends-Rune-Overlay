## What does it do?

**League of Legends Rune Overlay** is a simple node.js web-app that can be used to display an overlay with your currently chosen runes
on your stream. It can be used with any streaming software that is able to embed a web view.

The overlay can be manually scaled in your streaming software.

### TODO:
- add an **options** page into the web app that will allow users to make changes to the apperance and function of the overlay
- make the **options** persist using the user's local storage
- add info on how to build the app from source into README
